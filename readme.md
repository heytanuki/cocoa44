# 44% Cocoa

A choc-spaced, splittable 40 with hazard stripes across the top.

The 44% Cocoa was designed and sized to be under the 100mm^2 limit for free fabrication thru Allpcb. It is a little wider than 100mm wide, but that didn't seem to affect it being free!

### One small issue...

This has mounting holes directly under the top-left and top-right switches. What that means is that likely you will need to either use countersunk screws on those holes (the kind that have a conical head shape that's wider at the top), or change the size of the board to move those holes out to the side.
